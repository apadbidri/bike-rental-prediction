City Bike Rental Prediction using Neural Networks
Project Overview
This project aims to predict the total number of bike rentals in a city on an hourly basis, utilizing a neural network model. The goal is to help city planners optimize bike availability by providing accurate predictions based on historical data, including weather conditions, time of day, and other relevant factors.

The model uses features such as temperature, weather conditions, and hour of the day to forecast the total number of bike rentals. The model was trained on a dataset provided by the city's bike-sharing service, and the trained model can now be used to predict future rental activity.
